# Aircraft_crasher_data_analysis
## This dataset includes the airplane crahed that ranged from 1908 to 2009 Along with other categories: Time, Type, Fatalities, summary .etc I analyzed some cross relationship and present with the visuals.
### I use Python well-known data analytics packages, numpy, panda, matplotlib, and seaborn to analyze this dataset.
I manually found out some errors (Time format error) in the dataset and delete it, you can refer to my code for more detail

#### Result: 1. The chart indicates the accident frequencies increased dramatically during 1940s which is WWII period. 2. Also, the chart shows during the 1960s, the frequency went high again, it might because of the introduction of the jet planes, which wasn't and mature technology then.
